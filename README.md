# Vehicle Detection in Video Using Faster R-CNN

##  Transfer Learning and Bounding Boxes

## Objective -
This project demonstrates how to detect vehicles in a video using a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model. The pipeline includes extracting frames from a video, performing object detection on each frame, drawing bounding boxes around detected vehicles, and recompiling the processed frames back into a video.
